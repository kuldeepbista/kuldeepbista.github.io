*	Designed Chassis, RF Shields, heatsinks and performed thermal and structural analysis on them.
*	Supported projects from prototyping to production phase coordinating with interdisciplinary teams. 
*	Worked with vendors very closely to communicate requirements for mechanical build.
### Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley \- Engineering Intern \[Dec 2016 \- Dec 2017\]
*	Built a fully functional Bio-3D printer from scratch that was able to print human skin.
*	Led a group of 5 Engineering students to upgrade the Bio-3D printer adding multiple extrusion capabilities.
*	Customized Marlin Firmware, written in C/C++, to add multiple extrusion capabilities, multipoint temperature reading and variable z-height controller. 

## OTHER EXPERIENCE
### Berkeley Voyagers, UC Berkeley \- Founder \& Team Lead \[Jan 2017 \- July 2017\]
*	Led a team of 14 engineers representing UC Berkeley at NASAâ€™s 3D Printed Habitat Challenge.
*	Supervised the development of a 3d printing composite material of high compressive strength and the customization of a 3D printer to add capability to print composite materials.
*	Customized Marlin Firmware and G-Code to operate 3D printer.
### Thermal Hydraulic Lab, UC Berkeley \- Engineering Research Intern \[Dec 2016 \- Jan 2017\]
*	Developed an automated control system to regulate the temperature of the heater using LabVIEW.
*	Processed data using MATLAB to analyze mechanical behavior of high pressure & temperature autoclave for use in nuclear power plants.
### Aero\-SAE at UC Berkeley \- Wing Design and Integration Lead \[May 2016 \- Feb 2017\]
*	Researched, analyzed and made design decisions on wing such as airfoil selection and wing plan\-form.
*	Led to the development of a straight chord tapered edge wing that helped secure 2nd best position in maneuverability at Aero\-SAE west 2017 competition.
*	Developed testing methods and manufacturing plan for wing structures.

## SOFTWARE PROJECTS
*	Programmed path trajectory and motor control algorithms and created GUI to operate a real time multitasking robot that imitated the capability to detect and fix cracks on the wall using NI MyRIO and LabVIEW. https://repairbotblog.wordpress.com/
*	Developed Bull-Cow game using C++. https://github.com/kuldeepbista/MyProjects/tree/master/BullCowGame
*	Developed Tic-tac-toe using Python. https://github.com/kuldeepbista/MyProjects/tree/master/TicTacToeGame
